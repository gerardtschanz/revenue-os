> **From code to customers to cash** — The monetization operating system for developers

Revenue OS is a powerful [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) plugin that transforms the journey from building a product to generating revenue. It analyzes your codebase, identifies ideal customers, polishes your value proposition, and generates everything you need to start making money.

**Perfect for:** Indie hackers, solo founders, startup developers, SaaS builders, and anyone who builds great products but struggles to monetize them.

---

## Why Revenue OS?

Developers are great at building products but often struggle with:

| Challenge | Revenue OS Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **WHO** would pay for this? | AI-powered ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) discovery |
| **WHY** choose us over alternatives? | Value proposition frameworks that convert |
| **HOW MUCH** to charge? | Psychology-based pricing architecture |
| **WHERE** to find customers? | Community and channel identification |
| **WHAT** to say to them? | Ready-to-use outreach sequences |

Revenue OS provides a systematic, engineering-minded approach to monetization — because revenue is just another system to be designed and optimized.

## Data Persistence

Revenue OS stores your data in `~/.claude/revenue-os/`:

```
~/.claude/revenue-os/
├── product.json      # Product analysis
├── icp.json          # Ideal customer profiles
├── value-prop.json   # Value propositions
├── pricing.json      # Pricing strategy
└── outreach/         # Generated sequences
```

Data persists across sessions, allowing commands to build on each other.
